# Matrix Operations Framework â€“ Java

## Overview
This project implements a **Matrix class** in Java, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts such as constructors, deep copy, and matrix property checks. The class includes various methods for checking if the matrix is square, singular, symmetric, equal to another matrix, and upper triangular.

## Features
- `Matrix(int lines, int columns, int minimum, int maximum)` constructor to create a matrix with random values.
- `show()` method to print the matrix to the console.
- `isSquare()` to check if the matrix is square.
- `isSingular()` to check if the matrix is an identity matrix.
- `isSymmetric()` to check if the matrix is symmetric.
- `isUppertriangle()` to check if the matrix is upper triangular.
- `isEqual(Matrix other)` to compare the current matrix to another.

## Technologies
- Language: Java
- Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Matrix Algebra, Array Manipulation

## How to Compile and Run
1. Compile the code:
```bash
javac Matrix.java
