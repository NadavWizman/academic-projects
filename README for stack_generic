# Generic Stack & Stack of Stacks â€“ Java

## Overview
This project implements a **generic stack class in Java** that supports any data type and includes a demonstration of a **stack of stacks**. It shows usage of type parameters, basic stack operations, and reusability with different data types.

## Features
- Generic implementation: `Stack<T>`
- Methods: `push`, `pop`, `top`
- Supports multiple types: `Integer`, `String`, and even `Stack<T>` itself
- Demonstrates nested usage (`Stack<Stack>`)

## Technologies
- Language: Java
- Concepts: Generics, Stack Data Structure, Type Safety

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
javac Stack.java
java Stack
