# 📚 Academic Projects

This repository contains a collection of academic programming projects developed as part of my B.Sc. in Computer Science studies at Netanya Academic College.

The projects are written in **C** and **Java**, and demonstrate practical knowledge in algorithms, data structures, recursion, OOP, generics, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 C Projects
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `tower_of_hanoi` | Recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem, where disks can only move between adjacent columns. |
| `game_of_life` | Implementation of Conway’s Game of Life using a 3D array to simulate multiple generations. |
| `bitwise_tools` | Bitwise operations including binary manipulation, shifting, and compression logic. |
| `string_sorting_pointers` | Sorting an array of strings using pointer logic instead of direct value swapping. |

---

### 🔸 Java Projects
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `stack_generic` | A generic stack implementation with support for stacking stacks (stack of stacks). |
| `minmax_linkedlist` | Implementation of a generic `MinMax<T>` interface with a custom linked list and iterator. |
| `geometry_segments` | Classes for representing and comparing 2D geometric points and line segments. |
| `matrix_framework` | Matrix class with constructors, matrix property checks (square, identity, symmetric, etc.), and comparisons. |

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Java, C
- **Paradigms:** Object-Oriented Programming, Procedural Programming
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, GitHub

## 🔗 How to Run
Each project folder contains a `README.md` file with specific compilation and run instructions (typically using `javac`, `java`, or `gcc`).

---

## 📌 Notes
- This repository is intended for academic showcase purposes.
- Some projects were based on exercise requirements provided by the university, and all code implementations were written independently.
